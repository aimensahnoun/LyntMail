After creating an account, Lyntmail allows its users to create custom links

These links can be shared with the user's followers, any one that acceses these link are required to authenticated using one of the major social network accounts, such as Facebook , Google , Yahoo , and Github.

After doing so, the followers needed data such as Email , Full Name , and Phone number if available, Are forwareded to the link owner. 

And like that the user has easily captured a leads contact information within a few clicks.
